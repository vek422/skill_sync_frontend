# Removed percentage_complete to Fix Assessment End Issue

## Problem

The `percentage_complete` field was causing assessments to end prematurely on the frontend because it was returning falsy values (0, null, undefined) which was being interpreted as assessment completion.

## Changes Made

### 1. Store/Redux Slice (`assessmentSlice.ts`)

- **Removed** `percentage_complete: number` from `Progress` type
- **Removed** line that set `state.progress.percentage_complete = 100` in `completeAssessment` action
- Progress now only tracks `answered_questions` and `total_questions`

### 2. WebSocket Hook (`useAssessmentWebSocket.ts`)

- **Removed** `percentage_complete` from all progress-related message handlers:
  - `assessment_recovered` case
  - `answer_feedback` case
  - `progress_update` case
- **Added** `test_info` message handler for debugging
- **Fixed** option property references (`option_id` and `option` instead of `id` and `text`)

### 3. UI Components

#### TestInterface.tsx

- **Replaced** `progress.percentage_complete` with calculated percentage: `(progress.answered_questions / progress.total_questions) * 100`
- **Removed** unused `handleCompleteAssessment` function
- **Added** test button and `handleTestGetInfo` function for debugging

#### AssessmentWebSocketExample.tsx

- **Replaced** `progress.percentage_complete` with calculated percentage in multiple locations
- **Fixed** option property references to use correct field names
- **Updated** `process.env.NODE_ENV` to `import.meta.env.DEV` for Vite compatibility

## Result

- Assessment progress is now calculated locally from `answered_questions` and `total_questions`
- No dependency on potentially falsy `percentage_complete` from backend
- Assessment flow continues properly without premature termination
- Debug functionality added for testing WebSocket messages

## Technical Details

- Progress calculation: `(answered_questions / total_questions) * 100`
- Option interface: `{ option_id: string; option: string }`
- Test info message type: `get_test_info` â†’ `test_info` response logged to console
